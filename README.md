## HIV Recent Infection Testing Surveillance
### Overview
This end-point accepts data from EMR systems for the results of HIV Testing Services, and HIV Recent Infection Testing which is carried out for all new HIV+ infections that are identified. The test results are not returned to the patients as they are only used for public health uses.

This end-point receives all the HIV+ and recent infection results from the EMR at facility level, due to the small numbers of data expected about 50,000 per year
